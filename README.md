#About
A C++ neural network implementation according to assignment in Andrew Ng's machine learning course.

It uses a toy matrix library and applies gradient descent with fixed step size in backpropagation.

#Build
It needs a compiler with C++11 support, for example clang 3.4+ or gcc 4.8+. Visual C++ 2015 RC is also known to work.
